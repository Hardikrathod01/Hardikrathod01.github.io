| **Oct 2019 - Nov 2022** | **A Simulative Study of Storage Allocation Heuristics for Cross-Docking**|
| | *Technical University Dortmund, Dortmund* |
| | |
| | When compared to a storage warehouse, cross-dock warehouses have faster material movements. The service time of an order arriving at this warehouse is heavily influenced by the location of the SKU. As a result, it is critical to determine the storage location of an item in the warehouse so that order service time can be improved. According to the findings of the research, the problem of storage location assignment (SLAP) for cross-dock type warehouses has not been solved. As a result, in this master thesis, a simulative framework was created using the Python programming language to simulate cross-dock warehouses and solve SLAP.|

| **Dec 2016 – Apr 2017** | **Bachelor-thesis in Machinability Analysis of Hard material** |
| | *Gujarat Technological University, India* |
| | |
| | In this bachelor thesis, machinability analysis of a maraging steel (AISI Grade 250) has been carried out. The experiment setup consisted of maraging steel rod, K-type thermometer, arduino Uno, and surface roughness tester. In the turning operation with varying speed, feed and depth of cut in CNC machine, the data about surface roughness and temperature of the rod has been measured. This data was used to train artifical neural network (ANN) for predicting surface roughness and temperature for any combination of speed, feed and depth of cut. The accuracy of model was found to be +/- 2% for the surface roughness and for the temperature +/- 1%. |

| **Jul 2016 – Dec 2016** | **Face Recognition Robot with Raspberry-Pi Controller** |
| | *Gujarat Technological University, India* |
| | |
| | In this small bachelor project, my team and I were responsible to build a face recognition robot. The controller used in this robot was Raspberry pi and the camera used for face recognition was Pi-camera. The physical model of a robot was a miniature humanoid robot with which was controller with servo motors. A python program has been developed using built-in face recognition libraries, so that the robot makes a small dance move whenever a person is infront of the robot. It was a real nice get to know project of robotic systems during studies.|

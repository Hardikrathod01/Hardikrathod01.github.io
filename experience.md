| **Feb 2022 - Apr 2022** |  **Intern as software development of a backend for automatic error handling of AGVs in intralogistics** |
| | *Denso Automotive Germany GmbH, Eching* |
| | |
| | Working at Denso was a lot of fun, even if it was only for a short time. Internal material handling was handled by mobile robots (AGV) at the company's manufacturing units. When the robot encounters an error for whatever reason, it always comes to a halt at its current location. The robot's behavior was causing a loss of productivity. As a result, I was using binary class classification to classify the robot's error messages. The robot was then given a pre-determined action based on the message's class, resulting in less productivity loss. Python was used as a programming language to develop the machine learning model and to communicate with the robot via APIs. |

| **Nov 2019 - Dec 2021** | **Workstudent – Continuous Integration, Continuous Deployment Developer** |
| | *camLine GmbH, Dortmund* |
| | |
| | While pursuing my master's degree, camLine provided me with the opportunity to work as a CI/CD developer. I was an important member of the team, responsible for improving the build and deployment processes. I was in charge of developing pipelines for two of their products. We used two tools to build pipelines: GitLab CI/CD and Jenkins. To create pipeline code in Jenkins, I used the Groovy programming language. Pipelines had several stages, including build, code analysis, testing, and deployment. SonarQube was used to ensure code quality, and Docker was used to containerize application deployment. Linux systems served as the build and deployment environments. I am happy to share that I did not only work on pipeline creation but also on development on many occasions. I was using Java as a programming language to implement some of the key features.  |

| **Dec 2018 - Jun 2019** | **Java Developer** |
| | *Redbracket Digital Pvt Ltd., India* |
| | |
| | This was yet another exciting and challenging job for me. Architects can manage their projects using the platform on which I was working. Typically, a civil engineer manages all design file version manually. This problem is solved by the company's software. It enables them to keep track of project deadlines, maintain CAD file versions, and many other important features. I worked on the frontend (Angular JS), backend (Java), and MySQL database. Once again, I did not limit myself to development. I was also in charge of production deployments, artifact promotion, and server management.

| **Jun 2017 - Dec 2018** | **Systems Engineer** |
| | *Infosys Pvt Ltd, India* |
| | |
| | This was my first full-time job, and I recall the days when I was just starting out in the industry. I was very excited to start my career as a Systems Engineer at Infosys. I was working on the development of an Infosys DevOps Platform. This platform enables the creation of pipelines for 20+ programming languages without prior DevOps knowledge, as well as the use of 60+ DevOps tools for various purposes. Jenkins was used to store pipeline configuration. The programming language used to create pipeline code was Groovy. The platform's frontend is built in Angular 5, the backend in Java (Spring boot), and the database is PostgreSQL. I added support for tools like Docker, SAHI (for functional testing), SonarQube, and environment scheduling, which determines when an application is deployed in which environment. This platform's service is available in part as an open-source version <a href="https://github.com/Infosys/openIDP/" target="_blank">here</a>.|

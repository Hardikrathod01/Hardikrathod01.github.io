# HELLO,
{: style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right:100px; text-align: justify"}

I'm Hardik Rathod from India, and I'd like to introduce myself.
This website lets you go through my profile.
I have been in Germany since 2019. 
The reason I came to Germany was to study masters.
But why Germany and not any other country?
Well, there are many reasons behind that. 
The important reason is the quality of education provided in very economical way. 
The abundance of DevOps opportunities is the second major reason.
I have done my bachelors in Mechatronics from India and then applied in Germany to do masters in Robotics courses. 
And yes, I got the admission for Automation & Robotics course at TU Dortmund. 
And I have started my journey here in Germany!

While studying I had found my niche in DevOps and automation.
Therefore in my career I want to be in the same field.
My motivation is that I want to help companies improve their existing appliaction development practices.
Some of the internal processes in companies are monotonuous and more error prone.
Certain processes must be completed more efficiently and quickly so that the application/service can be launched in the market before competitors.
Such processes can be improved by using DevOps tools and technologies.
DevOps solutions can automate part or full application development process and in the end improve release time of an application.

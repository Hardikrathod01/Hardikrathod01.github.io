When the robot encounters an error for whatever reason, it always comes to a halt at its current location. The robotâ€™s behavior was causing a loss of productivity. As a result, I was using binary class classification to classify the robotâ€™s error messages. The robot was then given a pre-determined action based on the messageâ€™s class, resulting in less productivity loss. Python was used as a programming language to develop the machine learning model and to communicate with the robot via APIs.</td>

We used two tools to build pipelines: GitLab CI/CD and Jenkins. To create pipeline code in Jenkins, I used the Groovy programming language. Pipelines had several stages, including build, code analysis, testing, and deployment. SonarQube was used to ensure code quality, and Docker was used to containerize application deployment. Linux systems served as the build and deployment environments. I am happy to share that I did not only work on pipeline creation but also on development on many occasions.
